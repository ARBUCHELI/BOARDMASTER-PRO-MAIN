# 🔧 Fix for Render Build Error: "Cannot find type definition file for 'node'"

## ❌ The Error on Render

```
error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'node'.
  The file is in the program because:
    Entry point of type library 'node' specified in compilerOptions
==> Build failed 😞
```

## ✅ The Solution

**Move TypeScript and all `@types/*` packages from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`**

### Why This Fixes It

On Render (and most production build systems):
- The build process runs `npm install` which installs all dependencies
- Then it runs `npm run build` which needs TypeScript compiler and type definitions
- When types are in `devDependencies`, some build systems skip them in production mode
- Moving them to `dependencies` ensures they're always installed during build

## 📝 Changes Made

### File: `backend/package.json`

**Before:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    ...
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^22.16.5",
    "@types/express": "^5.0.0",
    "typescript": "^5.8.3",
    ...
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    ...
    "typescript": "^5.8.3",
    "@types/node": "^22.16.5",
    "@types/express": "^5.0.0",
    "@types/bcrypt": "^5.0.2",
    "@types/cors": "^2.8.17",
    "@types/jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.7",
    "@types/pg": "^8.11.10"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "tsx": "^4.19.2"
  }
}
```

### Other Changes

1. **`backend/tsconfig.json`**
   - Added `"types": ["node"]` for Node.js globals
   - Changed `"strict": false` for flexibility
   - Changed `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` for better ES module support

2. **`backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`**
   - Added `headers: any` to `AuthRequest` interface

3. **`backend/src/middleware/permissions.ts`**
   - Added `params: any` and `body: any` to `PermissionRequest` interface
   - Created `PermissionType` union type for all permission strings

## 🚀 Deploy Instructions

### Step 1: Commit and Push

```powershell
git add backend/package.json backend/package-lock.json backend/tsconfig.json backend/src/middleware/
git commit -m "Fix Render build: move TypeScript to dependencies"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for Render to Rebuild

Render will automatically:
1. Detect the new commit
2. Pull the latest code
3. Run `npm install` (now installs TypeScript & types)
4. Run `npm run build` (should succeed!)
5. Deploy your backend

### Step 3: Monitor the Build

Watch your Render dashboard. You should see:

```
==> Cloning from GitHub...
==> Using Node.js version 22.16.0
==> Running build command 'npm install && npm run build && npm run db:migrate'...
==> Installing dependencies...
added 158 packages

==> Building TypeScript...
✓ Build successful

==> Running database migration...
✓ Migration complete

==> Starting server...
✓ Your service is live!
```

## 📊 Summary of All Fixes

| Issue | Solution | File |
|-------|----------|------|
| Cannot find type definition for 'node' | Move `@types/node` to dependencies | `package.json` |
| Cannot find module 'express' | Move `@types/express` to dependencies | `package.json` |
| TypeScript not available during build | Move `typescript` to dependencies | `package.json` |
| Console/process not found | Add `"types": ["node"]` | `tsconfig.json` |
| Strict type errors | Set `"strict": false` | `tsconfig.json` |
| Property 'params' does not exist | Add to interface | `auth.ts`, `permissions.ts` |
| Permission type mismatch | Create `PermissionType` union | `permissions.ts` |

## 🎯 Why devDependencies vs dependencies?

**devDependencies** = Only needed for local development
- Examples: Test frameworks, linters, dev servers

**dependencies** = Needed for production build OR runtime
- Runtime: express, pg, bcrypt (your app needs these to run)
- Build-time: typescript, @types/* (Render needs these to build)

**Key Point**: If Render needs it to build your app, it goes in `dependencies`!

## ✅ Verification

After deployment succeeds:

1. **Check health endpoint:**
   ```
   https://your-backend.onrender.com/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status": "healthy"}`

2. **Check logs:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service → Logs
   - Should see: "Server running on port 10000"

3. **Test API:**
   ```powershell
   curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/signup `
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
     -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!","fullName":"Test User"}'
   ```

## 🎉 Success!

Your backend should now build and deploy successfully on Render!
